        We have longstanding and fruitful partnerships with farmers on whose raw materials we rely on. This is because we are committed to growing value in the communities where we operate.  
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, we work with local agricultural communities to support them grow our raw materials, which ensures a steady and long-term supply of our ingredients. In turn, the farmers are assured of high yields, a ready market for their produce, and timely payments.  Where appropriate, we help equip them with the knowledge, tools, and specialist support to develop sustainable agriculture.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Our crop financing and risk mitigation strategy protects our farmers from losses from unforeseen weather hazards. To date, we have contracted more than 47,000 sorghum and barley farmers. These farmers receive over KShs. 2 billion annually and help us attain our goal of sourcing 85% of our raw materials locally. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We partner with both small and large-scale farmers, women and youth farmers, and entrepreneurs. This approach is not only changing the lives of individual farmers but also transforming entire communities.
